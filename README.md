<h1>Stored procedure</h1>

This project aimed to build queries and insert results into tmp tables through a stored procedure to create the Profit and Loss (P&L) and Balance Sheet (B/S) statements. The first step we did was to brainstorm the problem, read the assignment requirements, open the database and check the most critical data and tables. Since there were so many unnecessary tables, we focus on the ones that didn't have the _tmp. 

The key SQL and technical learnings behind this challenge were being able to understand well the requirements under pressure, finding the transactions flow, correctly joining the right tables, using SQL functions to make the process faster and more automated, formatting the table and the columns entries, using a stored procedure to prepared SQL code that we could save it, so the code can be reused over and over again, defining the variables and insert values into the variables.

The takeaway that I could do differently is to make the SQL query reusable to apply it in different datasets to avoid re-coding. Next time we will focus on having clear comments on the code to be able to increase the team's understanding of each function.
